# Pizza-Ordering-GUI
CISC 124 Assignment to implement a GUI with java

Requirements:

- The user must be able to configure a pizza, by choosing a size, and then the cheese, pepperoni and ham toppings. The user's choices must be limited to legal options. For example, the sum of meat toppings cannot exceed three.
- Display the cost of the pizza configured by the user.
- The user must be able to specify a quantity of these pizzas and must be restricted to entering an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- Display the cost of this quantity of the configured pizza.
- A button is used to save the current pizza configuration and quantity as a line item which is added to the order being displayed. Instead of displaying the current order to the console, display it in the same way in a TextArea control. Every time this button is clicked by the user another line item is added to and displayed in the order.
- As the last line in the displayed order, show the total order cost (without tax!).
